<h3>What is the Tech Radar?</h3>

<p>
The Tech Radar is a list of technologies, complemented by an assessment result, called <i>zone assignment</i>. We use seven zones with the following semantics:
</p>

<ul>
<li><b>HOLD</b> &mdash; Technologies not recommended to be used for new projects. Technologies that we think are not (yet) worth to (further) invest in. HOLD technologies should not be used for new projects, but usually can be continued for existing projects.</li>
<li><b>ASSESS</b> &mdash; Technologies that are promising and have clear potential value-add for us; technologies worth to invest some research and prototyping efforts in to see if it has impact. ASSESS technologies have higher risks; they are often brand new and highly unproven in our organisation. You will find some engineers that have knowledge in the technology and promote it, you may even find teams that have started a prototyping effort.</li>
<li><b>TRIAL</b> &mdash; Technologies that we have seen work with success in project work to solve a real problem; first serious usage experience that confirm benefits and can uncover limitations. TRIAL technologies are slightly more risky; some engineers in our organization walked this path and will share knowledge and experiences.</li>
<li><b>ADOPT</b> &mdash; Technologies we have high confidence in to serve our purpose, also in large scale. Technologies with a usage culture in our Zalando production environment, low risk and recommended to be widely used.</li>
<li><b>DEPRECATE</b> &mdash; Technologies not recommended to be used for new projects. Technologies we have production code using, which we should maintain knowledge of. DEPRECATE technologies should not be used for new projects, but can be continued for existing projects.</li>
<li><b>REMOVE</b> &mdash; Technologies not recommended to be used for new or existing projects. Technologies we may have production services running, which we should actively migrate away. REMOVE technologies may be unmaintainable, or contain unmitigatable security risks. REMOVE technologies should be actively migrated away from at the expense of new features.</li>
<li><b>GONE</b> &mdash; Technologies not recommended to be used for new projects. Technologies that we have recently used, but are no longer suitable for use. GONE technologies should not be in use on any project.</li>
</ul>

<h3>What are those lines</h3>
<p>We feel that technology versions are as interesting as the technology itself. Java 8 is not Java 5, so simply saying "Java" is not enough to provide guidance. 
</p>

<h3>What is the purpose?</h3>

<p>
The Tech Radar is a tool to inspire and support engineering teams at Zalando to pick the best technologies for new projects; it provides a platform to share knowledge and experience in technologies, to reflect on technology decisions and continuously evolve our technology landscape. Based on the <a href="https://www.thoughtworks.com/radar">pioneering work of ThoughtWorks</a>, our Tech Radar sets out the changes in technologies that are interesting in software development &mdash; changes that we think our engineering teams should pay attention to and consider using or removing from their projects.

This radar is an extension of the common radar tools - while tools and technologies in the center are to be embraced, it also understands that many companies need to manage technologies that are leaving as much as those that are coming. 
</p>

<p>This tool was modelled on the Thoughtworks radar, but based off the zalando tech radar code, which was more suitable for descriptions here.
